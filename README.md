## Description of the Program

This program demonstrates a Spring Boot batch application that reads data from a CSV file, processes it, and then saves it to a MySQL database using JPA. The program uses Spring Batch framework for handling the batch processing.

The `BatchConfig` class is the main configuration class for the batch application. It defines various beans required for the batch processing, such as `LineTokenizer` for parsing CSV lines, `FieldSetMapper` for mapping fields to the `Invoice` object, `LineMapper` for mapping lines to objects, `FlatFileItemReader` for reading items from the CSV file, and `ItemWriter` for saving the invoices to the database.

The `processor()` method in `BatchConfig` class implements the logic for processing each invoice item. It calculates the discount and final amount based on the provided amount and discount percentage.

The `listener()` method in `BatchConfig` class defines a `JobExecutionListener` bean that logs the start and end time of the job execution.

The `BlankLineRecordSeparatorPolicy` class extends `SimpleRecordSeparatorPolicy` to handle records with blank lines in the CSV file. It overrides the `isEndOfRecord()` method to skip blank lines and the `postProcess()` method to return `null` for blank lines.

The `InvoiceListener` class implements the `JobExecutionListener` interface and provides implementation for the `beforeJob()` and `afterJob()` methods. It logs the start and end time of the job execution along with the job status.

The `JobRunner` class is a Spring `CommandLineRunner` component that launches the batch job. It uses the `JobLauncher` to run the job with the specified parameters.

Finally, the `SpringBootBatchExampleCsvToMySqlUsingJpaApplication` class is the main entry point for the application, where the Spring Boot application is initialized and started.

## Learning Points

By writing this program, I have learned the following:

1. Configuring and setting up a Spring Batch application.
2. Defining and configuring readers, processors, and writers for batch processing.
3. Handling CSV data using Spring Batch's `FlatFileItemReader` and customizing record separators.
4. Implementing business logic in the processor to transform data.
5. Saving processed data to a MySQL database using JPA.
6. Implementing job execution listeners to track the start and end of job execution.
7. Running the batch job using Spring's `JobLauncher` and providing job parameters.
8. Using Spring Boot to bootstrap and run the application.
